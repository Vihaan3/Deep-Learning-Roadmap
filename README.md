**Disclaimer: This is still in development. I wouldn't recommend using it yet (or really even looking at it).**&#x20;

I made this to help guide AI self-learning at Hack Club Colts Neck. This is a truncated and (far more) streamlined version of my self-studying in deep learning over the past few months. Each resource/topic has a couple of intuition-based questions that should hopefully probe at what I think people should understand. I'm still relatively inexperienced myself, so some questions may be wrong or misleading.&#x20;

Guide to using this (make a separate page at one point):&#x20;

* if you follow the full guide (minus the python section of coding), it'll be a time commitment of \~1 hour a day, this will probably take \~4 months (**edit: get a more precise timeline here by looking at toggle stats**) to complete&#x20;
* you probably already know some of this so you can skip around a lot
  * This is meant for people who want to go reasonably deep (or as much as possible in the given timeframe) and not just use things at a high level without understanding them. It's fine if that doesn't fit your goals, and you could probably finish even faster then.&#x20;
* don't learn passively
  * use a note-taking app + Anki
  * (if relevant) program along, or program afterwards
  * &#x20;You can do it! Stick with things that are hard and messy. I found tensor manipulations extremely annoying and unintuitive, and I never bothered to really build up my intuition for them. That's still affecting me today.&#x20;
    * It's easy to just let your eyes glaze over and become overwhelmed when you come across complex-looking equations and diagrams and difficult-sounding words and then to end up just skipping it. Make it a point not to do this! That will become a bad habit that will hamper you as you move forward. use ChatGPT/Claude/Gemini/Phind to help you out.&#x20;

My own journey (also make separate page)

* Used fast.ai because I thought it was the best way to get started
  * It was really good, but it went into a lot of things I wasn't interested in, and didn't go deep enough into others. Too "practical" for my tastes.&#x20;
* Felt there was a lot missing, so I spent a little while getting a very high-level overview of the math
* Took Andrej Karpathy's [Zero to Hero](https://karpathy.ai/zero-to-hero.html)&#x20;
  * Realized that I now knew a lot of fundamental theory but couldn't program much without handholding&#x20;
* Took [Arena](https://www.arena.education/)
  * Felt like I already knew a lot, and wasted a lot of time doing things that weren't necessarily that  important. There was also probably way too much handholding in the programming and not even in the theory. &#x20;

TODO

* [ ] Get a lot more questions from what I have in Anki (comb through the programming deck and drop good questions here).&#x20;
* [ ] Speedrun through all of this content and make more questions
* [ ] Sanity check all questions through ChatGPT/Claude/Phind
* [ ] Clean up
  * [ ] Separate into more sections and clean up formatting.
  * [ ] Add time estimates for each part
