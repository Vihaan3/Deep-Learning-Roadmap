**Disclaimer: This is still in development. I wouldn't recommend using it yet (or really even looking at it). Right now this is 30% real content and 70% rough outlines and comments to myself.**&#x20;

I made this roadmap to help guide AI self-learning at Hack Club Colts Neck. It's a truncated and streamlined version of my [journey](home/my-journey.md) self-studying in introductory deep learning material over the past few months. I've broken everything that I've learned down into a list of crucial topics with resources to learn from, problems to work on, and questions that probe at the knowledge I think you should take away. I'm still relatively inexperienced myself, so some problems or questions may be misleading; you can start issues [here](https://github.com/Vihaan3/Deep-Learning-Roadmap/issues) or contact me directly from whatever method works [here](https://vihaansondhi.substack.com/about#%C2%A7find-me). Read through my [guide](home/guide-to-using-this.md) before getting started, and use that to create a system that works for you.  I can guarantee that spending a couple hours into improving your learning process in advance will have a _**massive**_ return on investment that will carry over into anything you decide to self-learn in the future.&#x20;

TODO

* [ ] Convert everything to expandables&#x20;
* [ ] Actual content to cover personally:
  * [ ] From week 0 of ARENA
    * [ ] Go through [this](https://arena3-chapter0-fundamentals.streamlit.app/\[0.0]\_Prerequisites) in-depth and add questions from it + work on what you're weak on personally (calc and lin. algebra).
      * [ ] Find good vidoes, gpt threads, problem sets, worksheets, etc. You really struggled here w/ finding good ways to practice so make sure you add that and strongly emphasize it.&#x20;
    * [ ] Ray Tracing
    * [ ] Get more comfortable w/ Pytorch again (weeks of doing RL has really weakened your Pytorch skills)
      * [ ] [https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/nn\_tutorial.html](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/nn\_tutorial.html)
      * [ ] Speedrun
        * [ ] CNNs and ResNets
        * [ ] Optimization
        * [ ] VAEs and GANs
    * [ ] Backprop -> drill down on calc and lin algebra in advance and do completely from scratch and w/o help
    * [ ] For a lot of topics, look at the fast.ai 2 course and see if they're well-explained there.
* [ ] Get a lot more questions from what Anki (comb through the programming deck and drop good questions here) + fastbook questions.&#x20;
* [ ] Speedrun through all of this content and make more questions
* [ ] Sanity check all questions through ChatGPT/Claude/Phind
* [ ] Clean up
  * [ ] Separate into more sections and clean up formatting.
  * [ ] Add time estimates for each part
