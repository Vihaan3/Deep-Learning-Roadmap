**Disclaimer:** This is usable but still in active development and not yet in the ideal form I'd like it to be in. All sentences that begin with "TODO" are comments to myself.

I made this roadmap to help guide AI self-learning at Hack Club Colts Neck. It's a truncated and streamlined version of my [journey](home/my-journey.md) self-studying in introductory deep learning material over the past few months. I've broken everything that I've learned down into a list of crucial topics with resources to learn from, problems to work on, and questions that probe at the knowledge I think you should take away. **I'm still very inexperienced myself. A good heuristic for thinking about this resource, quality-wise, is that it's on par with what you would get if you asked a friend who had just finished a Psychology 101 course for a list of materials and tips on studying Psychology yourself**.&#x20;

If (when) you find questions and tips that may be misleading; you can start issues [here](https://github.com/Vihaan3/Deep-Learning-Roadmap/issues) or contact me directly using whatever method works [here](https://vihaansondhi.substack.com/about#%C2%A7find-me). Read through my [guide](home/guide-to-using-this.md) before getting started, and use that to create a system that works for you. I can guarantee that spending a couple hours on improving your learning process in advance will have a _**massive**_ return on investment that will carry over into anything you decide to self-learn in the future.&#x20;

TODO

* [ ] Actual content being convered personally right now: Key goal (**make sure you can answer all of the week0 arena core concept questions in calc, lin. algebra, and probability by yourself**)
  * [ ] From week 0 of ARENA
    * [ ] Go through [this](https://arena3-chapter0-fundamentals.streamlit.app/\[0.0]\_Prerequisites) in-depth and add questions from it + work on what you're weak on personally (calc and lin. algebra).
      * [ ] Find good vidoes, gpt threads, problem sets, worksheets, etc. You really struggled here w/ finding good ways to practice so make sure you add that and strongly emphasize it.&#x20;
    * [ ] Ray Tracing
    * [ ] Get more comfortable w/ Pytorch again (weeks of doing RL has really weakened your Pytorch skills)
      * [ ] [https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/nn\_tutorial.html](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/nn\_tutorial.html)
      * [ ] Speedrun
        * [ ] CNNs and ResNets
        * [ ] Optimization
        * [ ] VAEs and GANs
    * [ ] Backprop -> drill down on calc and lin algebra in advance and do completely from scratch and w/o help
  * [ ] Bonus exercises:
    * [ ] As many as are interesting from [here](https://arena3-chapter2-rl.streamlit.app/\[2.4]\_RLHF#learn-a-human-preference-reward-model)
      * [ ] learning a human preference reward model on down all look cool&#x20;
    * [ ] As many as are interesting from [here](https://arena3-chapter2-rl.streamlit.app/\[2.3]\_PPO#introduction-ppo-vs-dqn)
      * [ ] wordle and (to a lesser extent) other enviroments look cool
* [ ] Complete all TODOs
  * [ ] Linear Algebra
  * [ ] Calculus
  * [ ] Probability
  * [ ] Grokking the Fundamentals
    * [ ] [#neural-networks-basics](grokking-the-fundamentals.md#neural-networks-basics "mention")
    * [ ] [#optimization](grokking-the-fundamentals.md#optimization "mention")
    * [ ] [#good-practice](grokking-the-fundamentals.md#good-practice "mention")
  * [ ] Transformers: redo arena's transformer from scratch and then clean up everything.
  * [ ] Reinforcement Learning: add questions and clean up everything
* [ ] Sanity check all questions through ChatGPT/Claude/Phind
