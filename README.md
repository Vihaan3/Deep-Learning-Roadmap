**Disclaimer: This is still in development. I wouldn't recommend using it yet (or really even looking at it). Right now this is 30% real content and 70% outlines and comments to myself.**&#x20;

I made this to help guide AI self-learning at Hack Club Colts Neck. This is a truncated and (far more) streamlined version of my self-studying in deep learning over the past few months. I've broken it down into a list of topics, and each topic has an annotated list of resources with practice problems and intuition-based questions (note: I'm still relatively inexperienced myself, so some problems or questions may be misleading). This roadmap is basically an amalgamation of the three courses I've worked through (**edit: when the "my journey" page is a separate page, just link to there).** You can make contributions here: [https://github.com/Vihaan3/Deep-Learning-Roadmap](https://github.com/Vihaan3/Deep-Learning-Roadmap).

Guide to using this (make a separate page at one point):&#x20;

* if you follow the full guide (minus the python section of coding), it'll be a time commitment of \~1 hour a day, this will probably take \~4 months (**edit: get a more precise timeline here by looking at toggle stats**) to complete&#x20;
* you probably already know some of this so you can skip around a lot
  * This is meant for people who want to go reasonably deep (or as much as possible in the given timeframe) and not just use things at a high level without understanding them. It's fine if that doesn't fit your goals, and you could probably finish even faster then.&#x20;
* don't learn passively
  * use a note-taking app + Anki -> (**edit: go more in-depth into Anki, learning, try to find the Practical Deep Learning for Coders Lecture 0 (how to learn for this course) video, etc**)
  * For the programming sections program along, or re-program afterwards.&#x20;
    * A lot of these resources will have Jupyter notebooks. I have a 3 step process for learning with these that I like:
      * First, just passively run each cell and generally see if you understand what the code is doing.&#x20;
      * Second, delete each cell and re-implement it yourself.&#x20;
      * Third, do the whole thing yourself from scratch (or if that's too much, for an intermediate step, do increasingly larger chunks of the thing yourself).&#x20;
  * For the math&#x20;
    * Take notes + **do practice problems** (please do this. I didn't and wasted nearly a week really struggling before having to come back.)
  * You can do it! Don't rush through and be okay with taking your time. This is a complex topic, and learning it meaningfully well and in a way that will stick in the long-term is going to take a while. Stick with things that are hard and messy. I found tensor manipulations extremely annoying and unintuitive, and I never bothered to really build up my intuition for them. That's still affecting me today.&#x20;
    * It's easy to just let your eyes glaze over and become overwhelmed when you come across complex-looking equations and diagrams and difficult-sounding words and then to end up just skipping it. Make it a point not to do this! That will become a bad habit that will hamper you as you move forward. use ChatGPT/Claude/Gemini/Phind to help you out.&#x20;

My own journey (also make separate page)

* I could work on an independent project in my AP CSA class after the AP exam, and I wanted to make a cool AI resource for my Hack Club -> expected to spend a couple of weeks but I ended up falling in love
* My real journey
  * Used [fast.ai](https://www.fast.ai/)'s [Practical Deep Learning for Coders](https://course.fast.ai/) because I thought it was the best way to get started
    * It was really good, but it went into a lot of things I wasn't interested in, and didn't go deep enough into others. Too "practical" for my tastes.&#x20;
  * Felt there was a lot missing, so I spent a little while getting a very high-level overview of the math
  * Took Andrej Karpathy's [Zero to Hero](https://karpathy.ai/zero-to-hero.html)&#x20;
    * Realized that I now knew a lot of fundamental theory but couldn't program much without handholding&#x20;
  * Took [Arena](https://www.arena.education/)
    * Felt like I already knew a lot, and wasted a lot of time doing things that weren't necessarily that  important. There was also probably way too much handholding in the programming and not even in the theory. &#x20;

TODO

* [ ] Get a lot more questions from what I have in Anki (comb through the programming deck and drop good questions here).&#x20;
* [ ] Speedrun through all of this content and make more questions
* [ ] Sanity check all questions through ChatGPT/Claude/Phind
* [ ] Clean up
  * [ ] Separate into more sections and clean up formatting.
  * [ ] Add time estimates for each part
