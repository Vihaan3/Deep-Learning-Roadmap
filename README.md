**Disclaimer: This is still in development. I wouldn't recommend using it yet (or really even looking at it). Right now this is 30% real content and 70% outlines and comments to myself.**&#x20;

I made this roadmap to help guide AI self-learning at Hack Club Colts Neck. It's a truncated and streamlined version of my [self-studying](home/my-journey.md) in deep learning over the past few months. I've broken everything I've learned down into a list of crucial topics and built an annotated roadmap of resources combining the three courses I've learned from. I've added practice problems and intuition-based questions for every topic that point towards the type of understanding I think you should take away (note: I'm still relatively inexperienced myself, so some problems or questions may be misleading; you can make edits [here](https://github.com/Vihaan3/Deep-Learning-Roadmap)). Read through my [guide](home/guide-to-using-this.md) before getting started, and use that to create a system that works for you.&#x20;

TODO

* [ ] Get a lot more questions from what I have in Anki (comb through the programming deck and drop good questions here).&#x20;
* [ ] Speedrun through all of this content and make more questions
* [ ] Sanity check all questions through ChatGPT/Claude/Phind
* [ ] Clean up
  * [ ] Separate into more sections and clean up formatting.
  * [ ] Add time estimates for each part
