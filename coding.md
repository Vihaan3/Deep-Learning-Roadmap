# Coding

How to study: studying this in a distributed way (random small chunks of time) is fine &#x20;

Customize this roadmap based on your prior knowledge, but make sure you have all these skills down well before moving on.&#x20;



<details>

<summary>Get very familiar w/ Python</summary>

* [ ] Roadmap I would recommend
  * [ ] Learn Python w/ [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/python)
  * [ ] Practice a lot w/ [Exercism](https://exercism.org/tracksbe/python) -> If you think you're done practicing, practice for a few more hours. It's really important that you get the fundamentals down.&#x20;
  * [ ] Go through [this book](https://book.pythontips.com/en/latest/) and make sure you understand everything up to section 21

<!---->

* [ ] Other resources to use&#x20;
  * [ ] [MIT](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-0001-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-in-python-fall-2016/pages/syllabus/)'s intro to Python
  * [ ] [Harvard](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/)'s intro to Python
  * [ ] [Corey Schafer ](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-osiE80TeTt2d9bfVyTiXJA-UTHn6WwU) -> if there's anything in particular that you're confused by, it'll probably be explained really well in here

* [ ] Get familiar with Numpy:&#x20;
  * [ ] https://cs231n.github.io/python-numpy-tutorial/
* [ ] Get familiar with Pytorch:
  * [ ] [https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/basics/intro.html](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/basics/intro.html)
  * [ ] [https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/nn\_tutorial.html](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/nn\_tutorial.html)
* [ ] Practice Numpy and Pytorch
  * [ ] Implement as many of [these exercises](ps://github.com/rougier/numpy-100/blob/master/100\_Numpy\_exercises.ipynb) as you feel like doing in both Numpy and Pytorch
  *   [ ] Questions (shamelessly stolen from [https://arena3-chapter0-fundamentals.streamlit.app/\[0.0\]\_Prerequisites](https://arena3-chapter0-fundamentals.streamlit.app/\[0.0]\_Prerequisites)):&#x20;

      * At a high level, what is a `torch.Tensor`?
      * What is a `nn.Parameter`, and `nn.Module`? **-> something you kind of struggle w/ urself**
      * When you call `.backward()`, where are your gradients stored?
      * What is a loss function? In general, what does it take for arguments, and what does it return?
      * What does an optimization algorithm do?
      * What is a hyperparameter, and how does it differ from a regular parameter?
      * What are some examples of hyperparameters?

      &#x20;
* [ ] Getting better with tensors -> **do a lot of this, and do it well. When you feel like you're done, spend a few more **_**days**_** on it.**&#x20;
  * [ ] Learn einops and einsum with this: https://arena3-chapter0-fundamentals.streamlit.app/\[0.0]\_Prerequisites
  * [ ] https://arena3-chapter0-fundamentals.streamlit.app/\[0.1]\_Ray\_Tracing
  * [ ] Please do this well. I never built up a strong foundation with tensor manipulations and I still struggle whenever I embark on larger projects because of it.&#x20;
