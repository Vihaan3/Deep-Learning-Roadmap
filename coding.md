# Coding

Customize this roadmap based on your prior knowledge, but make sure you have all these skills down well before moving on. Some of the emphasis I place on coding practice might seem unnecessarily extensive, but trust me when I say that you will struggle if you don't do the appropriate practice.&#x20;

<details>

<summary>Get very familiar w/ Python</summary>

* [ ] Roadmap I would recommend
  * [ ] Learn Python w/ Kaggle&#x20;
    * [ ] [This](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/intro-to-programming) if you're a complete beginner to programming
      * [ ] Then, watch all lectures and _solve all questions_ up to week 6 of [CS50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2024/)
    * [ ] [This](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/python) if you already know how to program
    * [ ] [This](https://youtu.be/mgBpcQRDtl0) for a good refresher _after_ (video refreshers should never be a substitute for actual practice)
  * [ ] Practice:
    * [ ] from CS50
      * [ ] be able to do [these](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2024/psets/6/) and [these](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2024/practice/#after-week-6) with relative ease
    * [ ] if you need more practice, use [Exercism](https://exercism.org/tracksbe/python)
  * [ ] Go through [this book](https://book.pythontips.com/en/latest/) and make sure you understand everything up to section 21

* [ ] Other resources you can use if you don't like my roadmap
  * [ ] [MIT](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-0001-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-in-python-fall-2016/pages/syllabus/)'s intro to Python
  * [ ] [Harvard](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/)'s intro to Python
  * [ ] [Corey Schafer ](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-osiE80TeTt2d9bfVyTiXJA-UTHn6WwU) -> if there's anything in particular that you're confused by, it'll probably be explained really well in here

Stop here for now. I'll tell you to revisit this page once you're more familiar with the [basics](grokking-the-fundamentals.md) of neural nets.

<summary>Get familiar w/ Numpy</summary>

<summary>Get familiar w/ Pytorch </summary>

* [https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/basics/intro.html](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/basics/intro.html)
* [https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/nn\_tutorial.html](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/nn\_tutorial.html)

<summary>Practice Numpy and Pytorch</summary>

* Implement as many of [these exercises](ps://github.com/rougier/numpy-100/blob/master/100\_Numpy\_exercises.ipynb) as you feel like doing in both Numpy and Pytorch
* Answer these questions (shamelessly stolen from [https://arena3-chapter0-fundamentals.streamlit.app/\[0.0\]\_Prerequisites](https://arena3-chapter0-fundamentals.streamlit.app/\[0.0]\_Prerequisites)):&#x20;
  * At a high level, what is a `torch.Tensor`?
  * What is a `nn.Parameter`, and `nn.Module`?&#x20;
  * When you call `.backward()`, where are your gradients stored?
  * What is a loss function? In general, what does it take for arguments, and what does it return?&#x20;
  * What does an optimization algorithm do?&#x20;
  * What is a hyperparameter, and how does it differ from a regular parameter?
  * What are some examples of hyperparameters?

Stop here for now and revisit once more familiar with building a basic neural net.&#x20;

<summary>Getting Better with Tensors</summary>

Do a lot of this, and do it well. When you feel like you're done, spend a few more _days_ on it. I still have not become completely comfortable with tensor manipulation and that's been a chink in my foundation that has truly bottlenecked my progress.

* [ ] Learn einops and einsum with this: https://arena3-chapter0-fundamentals.streamlit.app/\[0.0]\_Prerequisites
* [ ] https://arena3-chapter0-fundamentals.streamlit.app/\[0.1]\_Ray\_Tracing
* [ ] Please do this well. I never built up a strong foundation with tensor manipulations and I still struggle whenever I embark on larger projects because of it.&#x20;
