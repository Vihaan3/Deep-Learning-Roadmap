# Guide to Using This

* &#x20;if you follow the full guide (minus the python section of coding), it'll be a time commitment of \~1 hour a day, this will probably take \~4 months (**edit: get a more precise timeline here by looking at toggle stats**) to complete&#x20;
* you probably already know some of this so you can skip around a lot
  * This is meant for people who want to go reasonably deep (or as much as possible in the given timeframe) and not just use things at a high level without understanding them. It's fine if that doesn't fit your goals, and you could probably finish even faster then.&#x20;
* This is a recommended roadmap, not anything set in stone. If you feel like you need to go deeper on a topic, go deeper. If you don't like the resources I recommend, look for other ones or ask me.&#x20;
* don't learn passively
  * use a note-taking app + Anki -> (**edit: go more in-depth into Anki, learning, try to find the Practical Deep Learning for Coders Lecture 0 (how to learn for this course) video, etc**)
  * For the programming sections program along, or re-program afterwards.&#x20;
    * A lot of these resources will have Jupyter notebooks. I have a 3 step process for learning with these that I like:
      * First, just passively run each cell and generally see if you understand what the code is doing.&#x20;
      * Second, delete each cell and re-implement it yourself.&#x20;
      * Third, do the whole thing yourself from scratch (or if that's too much, for an intermediate step, do increasingly larger chunks of the thing yourself).&#x20;
  * For the math&#x20;
    * Take notes + **do practice problems** (please do this. I didn't and wasted nearly a week really struggling before having to come back.)
  * You can do it! Don't rush through and be okay with taking your time. This is a complex topic, and learning it meaningfully well and in a way that will stick in the long-term is going to take a while. Stick with things that are hard and messy. I found tensor manipulations extremely annoying and unintuitive, and I never bothered to really build up my intuition for them. That's still affecting me today.&#x20;
    * It's easy to just let your eyes glaze over and become overwhelmed when you come across complex-looking equations and diagrams and difficult-sounding words and then to end up just skipping it. Make it a point not to do this! That will become a bad habit that will hamper you as you move forward. use ChatGPT/Claude/Gemini/Phind to help you out.
