# Guide to Using This

* Assuming you already know how to code (you can either pick up Python quickly or know it already) but know nothing else here, completing this roadmap in its entirety will probably take \~120 hours. Take this estimate with a mountain of salt as your mileage will definitely vary. A good target goal to set is \~7 hours a week. At that pace, you should be able to complete it in about 4 months (again, take this with a mountain of salt). &#x20;
* Know what your goals are and how you learn best.&#x20;
  * This is meant for people who want to go reasonably deep (or as much as possible in the given timeframe), and not just use libraries at a high level without understanding them. It's fine if that doesn't fit your goals, and in that case you can probably finish faster.&#x20;
  * If you feel like you need to go deeper on a topic, go deeper. If you don't like the resources I recommend, look for others or ask me.&#x20;
* Don't learn passively
  * use a note-taking app + Anki -> (**edit: go more in-depth into Anki, learning, try to find the Practical Deep Learning for Coders Lecture 0 (how to learn for this course) video, etc**)
  * For the programming sections program along, or re-program afterwards.&#x20;
    * A lot of these resources will have Jupyter notebooks. I have a 3 step process for learning with these that I like:
      * First, just passively run each cell and generally see if you understand what the code is doing.&#x20;
      * Second, delete each cell and re-implement it yourself.&#x20;
      * Third, do the whole thing yourself from scratch (or if that's too much, for an intermediate step, do increasingly larger chunks of the thing yourself).&#x20;
  * For the math&#x20;
    * Take notes + **do practice problems** (please do this. I didn't and wasted nearly a week really struggling before having to come back.)
  * You can do it! Don't rush through and be okay with taking your time. This is a complex topic, and learning it meaningfully well and in a way that will stick in the long-term is going to take a while. Stick with things that are hard and messy. I found tensor manipulations extremely annoying and unintuitive, and I never bothered to really build up my intuition for them. That's still affecting me today.&#x20;
    * It's easy to just let your eyes glaze over and become overwhelmed when you come across complex-looking equations and diagrams and difficult-sounding words and then to end up just skipping it. Make it a point not to do this! That will become a bad habit that will hamper you as you move forward. use ChatGPT/Claude/Gemini/Phind to help you out.
