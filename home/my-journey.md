# My Journey

It feels a little egotistical to make a page titled "My Journey" when I haven't done anything special, but I thought it would be good for you to get an idea of how I learned and the types of resources I'm basing this roadmap off of.&#x20;

* I could work on an independent project in my AP CSA class after the AP exam, and I wanted to make a cool AI resource to help the people in my Hack Club self-study -> expected to spend a couple of weeks but I ended up falling in love.&#x20;
* The journey
  * Used [fast.ai](https://www.fast.ai/)'s [Practical Deep Learning for Coders](https://course.fast.ai/) because I thought it was the best way to get started.
    * It was really good, but it went into a lot of things I wasn't interested in, and didn't go deep enough into others. Too "practical" for my tastes but what I would recommend for anybody else starting out.&#x20;
  * Felt like there were massive gaps in my knowledge, so I spent a little while getting a very high-level overview of the math.
  * Took Andrej Karpathy's [Zero to Hero](https://karpathy.ai/zero-to-hero.html)&#x20;
    * Realized that I now knew a lot of fundamental theory and had understood some tacit knowledge but couldn't program much without handholding&#x20;
  * Took [Arena](https://www.arena.education/)
    * Felt like I already knew a lot, and wasted a lot of time doing things that weren't necessarily that important.&#x20;
    * There was also probably way too much handholding in the programming and not enough in the theory + for some reason it was a lot easier for the things I was working on to feel disconnected from the actual problem I was trying to solve because of how abstracted it was.  &#x20;
