# My Journey

* I could work on an independent project in my AP CSA class after the AP exam, and I wanted to make a cool AI resource for my Hack Club -> expected to spend a couple of weeks but I ended up falling in love
* My real journey
  * Used [fast.ai](https://www.fast.ai/)'s [Practical Deep Learning for Coders](https://course.fast.ai/) because I thought it was the best way to get started
    * It was really good, but it went into a lot of things I wasn't interested in, and didn't go deep enough into others. Too "practical" for my tastes.&#x20;
  * Felt there was a lot missing, so I spent a little while getting a very high-level overview of the math
  * Took Andrej Karpathy's [Zero to Hero](https://karpathy.ai/zero-to-hero.html)&#x20;
    * Realized that I now knew a lot of fundamental theory but couldn't program much without handholding&#x20;
  * Took [Arena](https://www.arena.education/)
    * Felt like I already knew a lot, and wasted a lot of time doing things that weren't necessarily that  important. There was also probably way too much handholding in the programming and not even in the theory. &#x20;
