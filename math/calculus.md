# Calculus

<summary>Learning</summary>

I would recommend 3Blue1Brown's introduction to [calculus](https://www.3blue1brown.com/topics/calculus). Again, since it's relatively short, I'd recommend just watching the whole thing through.&#x20;

Concepts/Questions&#x20;

* If there's one thing you really need to get, it's the chain rule.
  * What is the derivative of g(h(x))?
* Derivative
  * How can you think of the derivative (as a graph)?
  * If you are driving a car, what is the derivative of your position with respect to time?
  * If you've taken Physics, what is the derivative of velocity with respect to time? &#x20;
  * Good intuitions for thinking about derivatives
    * Best constant approximation for the rate of change at a point.
    * As tiny nudges/wiggles (extremely useful for thinking about neural nets).
  * What is a partial derivative?

Answers to the questions from the last section:

* The derivative of g, evaluated at h(x), times the derivative of h wrt x.&#x20;
* It is approximately the graph of slope of the tangent line (not that tangent line itself) at a point (works because dt approaches 0).
* Speed
* Acceleration
* Derivative of a function wrt one of the variables with the other ones held constant.
