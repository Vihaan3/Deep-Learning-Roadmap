_This is going to look extremely familiar to the Linear Algebra section._&#x20;

I would recommend 3Blue1Brown's introduction to [calculus](https://www.3blue1brown.com/topics/calculus). Again, since it's relatively short, I'd recommend just watching the whole thing through.&#x20;

If there's one thing that you need to really get by the end, it's the chain rule.&#x20;
