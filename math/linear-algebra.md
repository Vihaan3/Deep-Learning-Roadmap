# Linear Algebra

<summary>Learn</summary>

I love 3Blue1Brown's [introduction to linear algebra](https://www.3blue1brown.com/topics/linear-algebra). Since it's relatively short, I'd recommend just watching the whole thing through.&#x20;

By the end, make sure you can answer the following questions (shamelessly stolen from Neel Nanda) -> **note: eventually adapt these questions to be more interconnected and go deeper**

* What is a basis?
* Does a vector space necessarily have a canonical basis?
* Understand that a matrix is a linear map between two vector spaces (or from a vector space to itself)
* What are orthogonal/orthonormal matrices, and how is changing to an orthonormal basis importantly different from just any change of basis?
* What are eigenvalues and eigenvectors, and what do these tell you about a linear map?

**TODO:** Add questions from Anki.&#x20;

**TODO**: Find good practice resources.

Optional (but **highly** recommended): Go back and read through [this wonderful introduction](https://quantum.country/) to quantum computing. It's been designed with spaced repetition at its core. While learning about quantum computing, you will also be understanding how experts use spaced repetition to learn technical topics effectively.&#x20;
