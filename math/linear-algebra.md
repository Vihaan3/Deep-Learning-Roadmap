# Linear Algebra

TODO:&#x20;

* [ ] link all the specific videos and tutorials you would recommend + some practice problems and questions from Anki to see how well they grok it.&#x20;

From Neel Nanda:

* [ ] Basis
* [ ] Change of basis
* [ ] That a vector space is a geometric object that doesn’t necessarily have a canonical basis
* [ ] That a matrix is a linear map between two vector spaces (or from a vector space to itself)
* [ ] What’s singular value decomposition? Why is it useful?
  * [ ] \*\*\*\*https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbBvuuNVfco
* [ ] What are orthogonal/orthonormal matrices, and how is changing to an orthonormal basis importantly different from just any change of basis?
* [ ] What are eigenvalues and eigenvectors, and what do these tell you about a linear map?
* [ ] Find matrix multiplication practice worksheets online and practice until it feels really easy
