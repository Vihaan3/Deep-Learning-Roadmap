# Linear Algebra

<summary>Learn</summary>

I love 3Blue1Brown's [introduction to linear algebra](https://www.3blue1brown.com/topics/linear-algebra). Since it's relatively short, I'd recommend just watching the whole thing through.&#x20;

By the end, make sure you can answer the following questions&#x20;

* From Neel Nanda
  * What is a basis?
  * Does a vector space necessarily have a canonical basis?
  * Understand that a matrix is a linear map between two vector spaces (or from a vector space to itself)
  * What are orthogonal/orthonormal matrices, and how is changing to an orthonormal basis importantly different from just any change of basis?
  * What are eigenvalues and eigenvectors, and what do these tell you about a linear map?
* From me
  * When is a transformation linear?
  * What is the idea of duality in vectors in linear algebra?
  * How can the change of basis be described?
  * Use what you know about linear combinations to explain why matrix multiplication works.
  * If a matrix is encoding a transformation, what does it mean to multiply it by a vector?

**TODO**: Find good practice resources.

Optional (but **highly** recommended): Go back and read through [this wonderful introduction](https://quantum.country/) to quantum computing. It's been designed with spaced repetition at its core. While learning about quantum computing, you will also be understanding how experts use spaced repetition to learn technical topics effectively.&#x20;
