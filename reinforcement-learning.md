# Reinforcement Learning

Disclaimer to add at the top: This part is the most shaky because I'm still very new to RL myself.&#x20;

[https://arena3-chapter2-rl.streamlit.app/](https://arena3-chapter2-rl.streamlit.app/\[2.1]\_Intro\_to\_RL) - speedrun through this again and add some comments on what exercises to do and what not to do. Add intuition questions.&#x20;

Intro to RL: [https://arena3-chapter2-rl.streamlit.app/%5B2.1%5D\_Intro\_to\_RL](https://arena3-chapter2-rl.streamlit.app/\[2.1]\_Intro\_to\_RL)

* [https://spinningup.openai.com/en/latest/spinningup/rl\_intro.html](https://spinningup.openai.com/en/latest/spinningup/rl\_intro.html) and [https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2018-02-19-rl-overview/](https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2018-02-19-rl-overview/) are apparently good -- skim to check quality&#x20;
* Use this link for Sutton and Barto instead: [https://web.stanford.edu/class/psych209/Readings/SuttonBartoIPRLBook2ndEd.pdf](https://web.stanford.edu/class/psych209/Readings/SuttonBartoIPRLBook2ndEd.pdf)&#x20;
* Questions should just be on all the fundamentals. Make sure that people have their fundamentals down _really_ well before they continue.&#x20;

Q-Learning and DQN: [https://arena3-chapter2-rl.streamlit.app/\[2.2\]\_Q-Learning\_and\_DQN](https://arena3-chapter2-rl.streamlit.app/\[2.2]\_Q-Learning\_and\_DQN)

* You were especially confused for this one for literal hours: try to remember what you were confused about and target questions to clear that up

PPO: [https://arena3-chapter2-rl.streamlit.app/\[2.3\]\_PPO](https://arena3-chapter2-rl.streamlit.app/\[2.3]\_PPO)

* A lot of the PPO design choices felt unmotivated until I learned more about VPG because policy gradient algorithms are kinda just fundamentally different that Q-learning algorithms. Include some good articles or GPT threads on those things first so that PPO doesn't just come out of left field.&#x20;
* You had a good GPT thread that cleared everything up for you. Potentially just link that.&#x20;
